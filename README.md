# webcw2 - Uni Chat Web Application

# Application consists of React frontend and Node.js backend.
# Interface-service is the front end service and global, post and authentication are backend microservice.

# Users are automatically added to their respective module chats making it seemless to network with others on the same modules.

In order to start the program, the following commands must be run:

```cd ./interface-service```

```(/interface-service) npm install react --save```

```cd ../```

```docker-compose build```

```docker-compose up```

Two accounts are already prepared for chat testing:
